    Go from zero to a working event-sourced app. Install NeoHaskell, deposit some money, and see your balance derived from events — not stored, derived.

  <Card title="How it compares to what you know" icon="setting">
    Event sourcing with compiler guarantees. See how NeoHaskell compares to EventStoreDB, Kafka, and Axon — tradeoffs, performance, and adoption path.

    Event sourcing reduces long-term cost. Understand the value proposition, risk assessment, and proof points — without the implementation details.

## Learn by building

The [NeoBank tutorial](/tutorial/) takes you from zero to a working banking service with accounts, transactions, transfers, and a complete audit trail. Each part builds one concept. It'll feel like enterprise software — it's about 200 lines of code.
