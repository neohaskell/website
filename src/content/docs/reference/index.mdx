description: API reference documentation for NeoHaskell modules, types, and functions.
---

Reference documentation provides the exact details — function signatures, type definitions, module APIs, and CLI commands. This is where you go when you know *what* you're looking for and need the specifics.

## How to read this section

Reference docs are organized by module. Each entry includes:

- **Type signature** — what goes in, what comes out
- **Description** — what it does, in one paragraph
- **Examples** — at least one usage example
- **Related** — links to concept pages and guides

:::caution[Coming Soon]
Reference documentation will be auto-generated from NeoHaskell source code. Hand-written entries will be added for cross-cutting patterns like error handling conventions and naming conventions.
