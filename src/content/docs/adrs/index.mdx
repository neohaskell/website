title: Architecture Decision Records
description: Records of significant architectural decisions in NeoHaskell and this documentation site.
---

Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) document the key choices made during development and the rationale behind each decision. Each ADR follows the format: **context** (why the decision was needed), **decision** (what was chosen), and **consequences** (what follows from the choice).

ADRs are immutable — if a decision is reversed, a new ADR is created referencing the original.

:::caution[Coming Soon]
ADRs will be added as architectural decisions are made during implementation. The first ADRs will cover the Diataxis-based documentation structure and the NeoBank tutorial domain choice.
