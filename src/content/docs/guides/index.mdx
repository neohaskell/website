Guides are goal-oriented — each one solves a specific problem. Unlike the tutorial, you don't need to read them in order. Pick what you need.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Testing" icon="approve-check">
    Given-When-Then patterns, projection testing, and property-based testing.

    [Testing guide →](/guides/testing/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Error Handling" icon="warning">
    Typed errors, Result patterns, and error propagation across bounded contexts.

    [Error handling guide →](/guides/error-handling/)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Deployment" icon="rocket">
    From NeoHaskell code to a running service in production.
