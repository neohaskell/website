Core Concepts explain the *why* behind NeoHaskell. Each page takes a concept you'll encounter in the tutorial and gives it the full treatment — mental model shift, concrete examples, and how the compiler enforces it.

## Start here

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Why NeoHaskell?" icon="star">
    What NeoHaskell offers, how it compares, and when it's NOT the right choice.

  </Card>
  <Card title="From CRUD to Events" icon="right-arrow">
    The most important mental model shift — from UPDATE statements to event streams.

  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## How to read this section

Every concept page follows a pattern:

1. **What You Might Expect** — starting from your CRUD assumptions
2. **Why That Breaks** — the specific failure that motivates the shift
3. **The Mental Model Shift** — what changes in how you think
4. **In NeoBank Terms** — explained using the banking domain from the tutorial
5. **The Full Picture** — complete explanation with code

You don't need to read these in order. Each page stands alone. But if you're following the tutorial, the concept pages are linked at the moments they become relevant.
